  title = {Proving Correctness of the Basic {TESLA} Multicast Stream Authentication
	Protocol with {TAME*}},
  booktitle = {Workshop on Issues in the Theory of Security},
  year = {2002},
  address = {Portland, OR},
  abstract = {The TESLA multicast stream authentication protocol is distinguished
	from other types of cryptographic protocols in both its key management
	scheme and its use of timing. It takes advantage of the stream being
	broadcast to periodically commit to and later reveal keys used by
	a receiver to verify that packets are authentic, and it uses both
	inductive reasoning and time arithmetic to allow the receiver to
	determine that an adversary cannot have prior knowledge of a key
	that has just been revealed. While an informal argument for the correctness
	of TESLA has been published, no mechanized proof appears to have
	previously been done for TESLA or any other protocol of the same
	variety. This paper reports on a mechanized correctness proof of
	the basic TESLA protocol based on establishing a sequence of invariants
	for the protocol using the tool TAME, an interface to PVS specialized
	for proving properties of automata. It discusses the organization
	and process used in the proof, and the possibilities for reusing
	these techniques in correctness proofs of similar protocols, starting
	with more sophisticated versions of TESLA.}

	of lazy data-types as a simple way of building an efficient on-the-fly
	model checker for protocols with infinite state spaces. The second
	is the integration of symbolic techniques for modeling a Dolev-Yao
	intruder, whose actions are generated in a demand-driven way. We
	present experiments that demonstrate that our tool is state-of-the-art,
	both in terms of coverage and performance, and that it scales well
	to industrial-strength protocols. This work was supported by the

  abstract = {Entity authentication and key distribution are central cryptographic
	problems in distributed computing -- but up until now, they have
	lacked even a meaningful definition. One consequence is that incorrect
	and inefficient protocols have proliferated. This paper provides
	the first treatment of these problems in the complexity-theoretic
	framework of modern cryptography. Addressed in details are two problems
	of the symmetric, two-party setting: mutual authentication and authenticated
	key exchange. For each we present a definition, protocol and proof
	that the protocol meets its goal, assuming the (minimal) assumption
	of pseudorandom function. When this assumption is appropriatly instantiated,
	the protocols given are practical and efficient.},
  added-by = {sti},
  annote = {Interesting (and first?) paper formally definining mutual authentication
	and (based on that) authenticated key distribution ('[]' in the folowing)
	. Model is based on adversary as network scheduler which ``drives''
	users as oracle-machines (partner and session ids, shared key, past
	conversion and coins as input; return value: (Ok|Fail|Continue),
	[return-message], [agreed secret]). Security definition based on
	matching sessions of fresh (unopened) sessions [and indistinguishability
	of session keys/polynomial security]:\\ - completness = acceptance
	iff matching conversation, [session key identical and correctly distributed]\\
	- soundness = matching conversation iff acceptance, [session key
	indistinguishable from random chosen in a game with unlimited numbers
	of 'reveals' and one single 'test' (restricted to insistance not
	related to compromised users/peers). (note that this means that session
	key cannot be used during the protocol in any form!)]\\ Describes
	two times two efficient protocols achieving each of above goals in
	a provable manner given secure pseudorandom function exist and a

	more powerful (e.g., BelRog rules out any 2 rounds protocols) models

	provide the level of assurance required by both developers and users

	of security protocols can be attempted using abstraction-based approximation.
	For this purpose, tree automata approximations were introduced by
	Genet and Klay in 2000. In this paper, we propose an extension of
	their techniques making the approach efficiently automatic. Our contribution
	has been implementing in the TA4SP tool with a high level specification

  abstract = {A strand is a sequence of events; it represents either the execution
	of an action by a legitimate party in a security protocol or else
	a sequence of actions by a penetrator. A strand space is a collection
	of strands, equipped with a graph structure generated by causal interaction.
	In this framework, protocol correctness claims may be expressed in
	terms of the connections between strands of different kinds. In this
	paper, we develop the notion of a strand space. We then prove a generally
	useful lemma, as a sample result giving a general bound on the abilities
	of the penetrator in any protocol. We apply the strand space formalism
	to prove the correctness of the Needham-Schroeder-Lowe protocol (G.
	Lowe, 1995, 1996). Our approach gives a detailed view of the conditions
	under which the protocol achieves authentication and protects the
	secrecy of the values exchanged. We also use our proof methods to
	explain why the original Needham-Schroeder (1978) protocol fails.
	We believe that our approach is distinguished from other work on
	protocol verification by the simplicity of the model and the ease
	of producing intelligible and reliable proofs of protocol correctness
	even without automated support.}

	discrete logs: $g^x$: ``public apriori knowledge on secret'' with
	$x$ random choosen such that $s$ is hard core predicate on $x$ (depending
	on application (e.g. when $s$ uniform/with enough entropy over $\Z{q}$)
	it also could also be directly chosen as $s$.) Share: $f_i$: coefficient

	we motivate the problem and discuss methods of threshold change when
	the dealer is still active and can use broadcasting to implement
	the change required. Next we study the case when participants themselves
	initiate the change of threshold without the dealer's help. A general
	model for threshold changeable secret sharing is developed and two
	constructions are given. The first generic construction allows the
	design of a threshold changeable secret sharing scheme which can
	be implemented using the Shamir approach. The second construction
	is geometrical in nature and is optimal in terms of the size of shares.
	The work is concluded by showing that any threshold scheme can be
	given some degree of threshold change capability.},

  abstract = {The private keys used in a PKI are its most important asset.Protect
	these keys from unauthorised use or disclosure is essential to secure
	a PKI. Relying parties need assurances that the private key used
	to sign their certificates is controlled and managed following pre-defined
	statement policy. Hardware Security Modules (HSM) offer physical
	and logical protection and should be considered for any PKI deployment.
	The software that manages keys inside an HSM should control all life
	cycle of a private key. Normally this kind of equipment implements
	a embedded key management protocol and this protocols are not available
	to public scrutiny due to industrial interests. Other important issue
	is that HSMs are targeted in their development to the Bank industry
	and not to PKI, making some important PKI issues, like, strict key
	usage control and a secure auditing trail, play a secondary role.
	This paper presents an open protocol to securely manage private keys
	inside HSMs. The protocol is described, analysed and discussed.},

	propose a readily automatable style of specification which simply
	asserts that a node can only complete its part in a protocol run
	if the pattern of messages anticipated by the designer has occurred.
	While this intensional style of specification does not replace more
	abstract ones such as confidentiality, it does appear to preclude
	a wide range of the styles of attack that are hardest to exclude

	secret sharing scheme with the property that the validity of the
	shares distributed by the dealer can be verified by any party; hence
	verification is not limited to the respective participants receiving
	the shares. We present a new construction for PVSS schemes, which
	compared to previous solutions by Stadler and later by Fujisaki and
	Okamoto, achieves improvements both in efficiency and in the type
	of intractability assumptions. The running time is O(nk), where k
	is a security parameter, and n is the number of participants, hence
	essentially optimal. The intractability assumptions are the standard
	Diffie-Hellman assumption and its decisional variant. We present
	several applications of our PVSS scheme, among which is a new type
	of universally verifiable election scheme based on PVSS. The election
	scheme becomes quite practical and combines several advantages of
	related electronic voting schemes, which makes it of interest in
	its own right.},

  abstract = {We consider the problem of threshold secret sharing in groups with
	hierarchical structure. In such settings, the secret is shared among
	a group of participants that is partitioned into levels. The access
	structure is then determined by a sequence of threshold requirements:
	a subset of participants is authorized if it has at least k0 0 members
	from the highest level, as well as at least k1 > k0 members from
	the two highest levels and so forth. Such problems may occur in settings
	where the participants differ in their authority or level of confidence
	and the presence of higher level participants is imperative to allow
	the recovery of the common secret. Even though secret sharing in
	hierarchical groups has been studied extensively in the past, none
	of the existing solutions addresses the simple setting where, say,
	a bank transfer should be signed by three employees, at least one
	of whom must be a department manager. We present a perfect secret
	sharing scheme for this problem that, unlike most secret sharing
	schemes that are suitable for hierarchical structures, is ideal.
	As in Shamir's scheme, the secret is represented as the free coefficient
	of some polynomial. The novelty of our scheme is the usage of polynomial
	derivatives in order to generate lesser shares for participants of
	lower levels. Consequently, our scheme uses Birkhoff interpolation,
	i.e., the construction of a polynomial according to an unstructured
	set of point and derivative values. A substantial part of our discussion
	is dedicated to the question of how to assign identities to the participants
	from the underlying finite field so that the resulting Birkhoff interpolation
	problem will be well posed. In addition, we devise an ideal and efficient
	secret sharing scheme for the closely related hierarchical threshold
	access structures that were studied by Simmons and Brickell.},

The proposed system will use the mobile phone as a software token and generate unique one time passwords (OTP) that will be used when authenticating to an Internet Banking application. The tokens can also serve as a method of signing online money orders. We will prove in this article the cost efficiency of the proposed architecture for both consumers and companies.},
